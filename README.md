# Learning GO and C++ with christmas themed puzzles
Thanks for checking out my repository, I will be updating the readme sporadically and code daily. Please note that the questions and input text are not included. To see the questions and inputs, you will have to visit the links found at the bottom.
## Why
I seemed to ask myself more often as the puzzles got harder. The fact that GO does not have common data structures as inbuilt imports and methods are mostly external of the variables and need to be constantly imported were big hurdles at the start. However, it was a fun way to learn a language with a scoreboard at the end each day and I think I'm slowly coming around to enjoying GO. Then I began C++, the dead rat mascot language.

#### What each thing means
```
 Part: Each day is given two problems where the second one builds upon the first one in some way
 Day: as you guessed, represents the day that the puzzle was handed out
 Time: the amount of time since the puzzle's release that the right solution was turned in from me
 Rank: global rank based on time
 Score: points given to the top 100 ranked individuals globally daily
```
